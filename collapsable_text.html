  <p>Ben is an innovative strategic consultant with nearly 30 years of professional experience in the non-profit sector, specializing in optimizing value for customers while maintaining a responsible budget. Over 10 of those years were in youth athletics as Program Director for Triangle FC (which later merged with CASL to form the NCFC Youth soccer organization). During his time at Triangle FC, the organization earned national recognition from United Soccer Leagues for operational excellence, created and grew one of the most successful annual showcase events in youth soccer, and became one of the most respected and recognized brands on the East Coast despite being geographically located in area with numerous competitors.

In this role, Ben has been a central figure in the growth of our brand and the creation of a new community following last year’s merger by:
 <p>
* Leading our social media efforts (including the #CarryTheFlag campaign)<p>

* Providing executive leadership with valuable data used to navigate the competitive landscape in North Carolina youth hockey<p>
* Identifying opportunities for strategic partnerships to drive growth and ensure long-term program success
 <p>
As a Board Member, Ben will emphasize the strength of our program locally, the recognition of our program nationally, and most importantly, the reputation of our program among our players, coaches, and families.

<div class="content">
  <p>I grew up playing hockey on the rinks, frozen ponds and neighborhood cul-de-sacs of New Jersey with my highest level of competitive play being club hockey on the campus of Salisbury University. I began coaching in the Polar House Hockey League in 2014 and have coached at the Mites through Peewee divisions. Currently, I serve as Assistant Coach with the Junior Hurricanes 10U Girls A and Tournament teams. I have also assisted with the Kindercanes, Learn-to-Play and Carolina Hurricanes First-Goal programs.  I hold a Level 4 coaching certification through USA Hockey.<p>

Since 2009, I have served as Marketing Manager/Graphic Designer with The EI Group, Inc., an environmental consulting firm headquartered in Research Triangle Park.  Previous business and marketing experience also includes work with KPMG Corporate Finance, Fieldstone Investment Corporation as well as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration and Marketing Management from Salisbury University in Salisbury, Maryland. <p>
 
My goal in joining the Junior Hurricanes Board of Directors would be to create positive, lasting change geared towards improving an already great youth hockey experience for all; players, parents, coaches as well as administrators. I feel as though I can add value to the organization, drawing from my own hockey and business experience; specifically in the areas of outreach, marketing and communications and streamlined processes. As a hockey parent and member of the Junior Canes family, I believe I can bring a different perspective along with fresh, new ideas designed to strengthen the organization’s footing in the hockey community and beyond.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Maggie Laplante – maggie.laplante@gmail.com
</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>My name is Maggie LaPlante and I would love to serve as a member of the BOD of the Carolina Junior Hurricanes.  My experience as a team manager and as a member and president of the Alumni Advisory Board of the College of Sciences at NC State University, along with my career as an educator and dedication to serving my community, bring together the perfect mixture of skills to serve the Jr Canes with efficiency and poise.<p>
I am a Raleigh native, having attended Hunter, Ligon and Broughton before attending NC State on a Park Scholarship.  After graduation, I moved to Boston for a job in finance.  Finance was not the career for me - too much money, not enough good deeds - so, I followed a passion that I had for years and switched my career to teaching.  I taught Upper School and Middle School Math at the Woodward School for Girls in Quincy, MA and the Belmont Hill School in Belmont, MA.  During my time in Boston, I also received a full academic scholarship to pursue my MS in Pure Mathematics at Tufts University.  After the completion of my masters degree, Chris’s job transferred us back to Raleigh where I taught PreCalculus, AP Stats and Geometry at Ravenscroft.  Since the birth of my second son, Marshall, I have been a personal math tutor.<p>
My personal education and my career as an educator certainly bring relevant experience to BOD membership, but it’s my volunteer work that I’m most proud of and that truly makes me the ideal candidate.  I served for 10 years on the Alumni Advisory Board of the College of Sciences at NC State, serving the last 4 years as President of the Board.  In September of 2019, I was awarded the Zenith Medal of Service by the College of Sciences, an award given to one alumnus a year who has shown exemplary dedication to serving the College.   I served on the BOD for the Raleigh Dance Theatre for 2 years and have been a dedicated member of the NC State Park Scholarship Selection Committee, both at the regional and finalist levels, for the past 17 years.  Since 2015, I have served as the lead librarian at the Raleigh campus of Thales Academy.  This is a volunteer position that requires leading a group of more than 20 volunteers, as well as managing the budget and inventory of the library.  As Marshall will graduate 5th grade this year, I will be rolling out of serving as the lead librarian, making this year an excellent year to take on a new volunteer leadership position.<p>
My two sons, Wesley (12UA Major) and Marshall (10UA Major), play for the Junior Canes.  I am the team manager for Marshall’s team.  Although this has been a tough year to be a team manager, I have found it rewarding to help families navigate the travel hockey experience.  My two boys have my whole heart and anything I do for them, I do with enthusiasm and a passion you just can’t muster for anyone other than your kids.  Serving on the BOD for the Junior Canes is, for me, about serving my children, their teammates and their teammates’ families.  I am really proud when I see the Jr Canes approach leadership with transparency and preparedness and I hope to encourage more of that as a member of the BOD.  I aspire to serve as an ambassador for the team managers, players and their families that are served by the BOD of the CJHHA.

<div class="content">
  <p><b>Experience:<p>
Hockey:</b> I grew up in New York and moved to NC in middle school.   I played travel hockey in Greensboro up until graduating high school. After High School I went on to play in the USHL for a brief stint then went on to play for the Great Northern Snow Devils in Bideford ME.   After spending 3 seasons with the Devils I got called up to play for the London Knights in the OHL.    I have played a few games in the minor leagues.   I am currently coaching U10 Girls hockey.<p>        
<b>Business:</b>  I currently own Yardology, a construction company. Yardology employs around 70 full time employees and we do an average of $7m per year.  As the president of Yardology I typically deal with all financial decisions, P&L’s, and logistics for all jobs.  Prior to starting Yardology I worked at Wells Fargo as a commercial banker for 14 years.  I was consistently ranked in the top 5 nationwide.  I handled all aspects of lending and managed over 35 loan officers.    Prior to Wells Fargo I owned an indoor Paintball Arena in Las Vegas named VIPA.   <p>
 I feel I would be a great addition to the board due to my background in competitive hockey and running my own businesses.   One of the first items I would like to work on as a board member is a Long-Term Player Development plan to keep all coaches developing skill sets that carry on to the next age group.   I feel that the Jr. Canes organization has some amazing coaches but we could improve by encouraging collaboration between coaches to develop our long term plan.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Danielle Webster – Danielle.webster@juniorhurricanes.org
</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Danielle Corrigan-Webster began her career in management at the young age of
nineteen, when she took over as owner/operator of three General Nutrition Center stores in
Durham, Hillsborough, and Sanford. In 2007, she took over as President for Hillandale Soccer
Association, a 650-player soccer organization, as well as served on the Board of Directors for
two years where she spearheaded many new programs and initiatives. She soon cracked open
the door to the hockey world by becoming the President of the Carolina Eagles for two years,
and the scheduler for ten teams two years after.<p>

As of late, Danielle has emerged as an important piece to the continued success of the
Carolina Junior Hurricanes. She has served as a team manager for five years with the Carolina
Eagles and Junior Hurricanes. Along with managing these teams, she served as the scheduler for
the past two years, providing over 25 teams per year with favorable, complete schedules. She
has not only done this under normal circumstances, but has proven herself to function well
under less favorable circumstances as well. During the troubling hockey season of 2020-21
amidst the global pandemic surrounding COVID-19, she has managed to continue to provide
the Junior Hurricanes with over 451 games played through the month of December, averaging
six more games per team than the state average.<p>

Danielle’s goal as a member of the BOD for the Junior Hurricanes revolves around her
desire to turn Raleigh into a hockey city in any way she can. As her kids have grown up under
the Raleigh youth hockey umbrella, she has seen the growth and development that both the
players and organizations have experienced through time, and would love to bring her drive
and hard work to the board to continue this growth.<p>

Danielle is not only cut out to be on the Carolina Junior Hurricanes Board of Directors,
but is the best fit for the position. Danielle brings an undying dedication to give the youth
hockey players of North Carolina the best possible experience. All three of her children have
played in the Junior Hurricanes and/or Carolina Eagles systems for a span of eight years, so she
knows the in’s and out’s of youth hockey. With her business savvy, management style, and
hockey experience over the past 24 years, she provides honest yet kind responses to issues and
has proven herself to be an efficient problem solver. Her rare combination of honesty, integrity,
balance and unique personality make her a rare commodity and a must-have on the
organization’s board.

As a board member, Rob will emphasize the strength of our program and help in continuing to build the Jr. Canes brand in our community among our players, coaches, and families.  He will work to provide the best opportunities for our kids as they grow into young adults both on and off the ice.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Michelle Bigham – michelle.bigham@juniorhurricanes.org
</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>My name is Michelle Bigham and I’m asking for your vote for the Junior Hurricanes Board of Directors.  I believe I have the right experience and motivation for the role; so let me share a little bit about me for those I’ve not met.<p>
 
<b>My Experience: </b><p>
 
For over 7 years, I have given countless hours to ensure our kids and families have a good experience.  Prior to the merger with the Junior Hurricanes,  I served on the Carolina Eagles board for 5 years.  I’ve seen firsthand the value of each program and how they complement each other. Each program had its own strengths and my work over the last seven years has given me opportunities to build and develop both organizations.  My involvement started when my older son, Cole, was a Squirt and continues now with two kids in the organization (Cole is now a 2nd year Midget and Ryan is a 2nd year PeeWee).  Since then, I’ve been Director of Managers, Travel Director, served on the Tryout committee and the Social committee (as for this last part, you haven’t seen us this year, but we had amazing Casino Nights and Barbecues in the past!).   <p>
 
I consider my biggest strength to be my perspective; I know the game well but I am not a hockey expert.  Therefore I constantly want to hear from members on your experiences.  This is why I worked to develop surveys like the tryout feedback, coach evaluations, experience evaluations, etc.  Things aren’t perfect and while that cannot be the expectation, we should expect to make things better year over year. I strive to constantly enhance the experience.   <p>
 
In addition to my experience on the Board, in my professional life I work in Human Resources.  I am trained in how to resolve grievances, how to improve performance, how to motivate people to perform at their best - all valuable skills in this position.<p>

<b>My Motivation:</b><p>
 
My focus has always been on making this the best organization it can possibly be.  Values are important to me – first, hockey is family – we need to make sure we always treat it as such.  Also, integrity, respect, pursuit of excellence, teamwork, sportsmanship – character counts. Neither of my kids is going to the NHL (shhh, don’t tell them) so I am not here for an NHL career. I am here for all the life lessons that come from hockey and therefore it is essential that I help create an environment where the important things count: perseverance, striving for excellence, discipline.  Learning to fail is as important as learning to win but the environment has to be right to make sure that any failures are transformed into success. Of course, I want to work hard so that we have winning teams as well!<p>
 
To make sure we all succeed, your input is crucial.  What do you love? What needs work?  Together, we can make a great program for both Boys and Girls, AAA to A.  I have always welcomed your feedback and will continue to do so.  The most important part of all of this is our kids - and I promise never to forget that.<p>
 
We are replacing 4 out of 7 positions – this is a majority.  I am the only candidate that has previous experience on this board.  I am so excited for the influx of new ideas and thoughts.  I know several people who are also running and every one of them is an absolutely phenomenal person which gives me great hope for the future of our organization.  My experience can help us make sure we hit the ground running so we can make the most out of this opportunity.<p>
 
Thank you in advance for your consideration - and I hope for your vote!

the organization and the development of our players, on and off the ice.

  <p>I am interested in taking on a BOD role with the Jr Canes simply because I care deeply about the young men and women playing hockey in the Carolinas, and I believe my experience with the game and my passion for developing hockey players can help bring the program forward for the next generation. For those of you who do not know me, below is summary of my experience, and I appreciate your consideration.<p>
I was able to play the game at a very high level. I attended a D1 prep school for 3 years and was a captain. In the summer I competed for Team Massachusetts at the USA Hockey Select 15, 16, and 17 festivals. I was selected to participate in the inaugural Team USA NTDP, but decided to complete my high school diploma at Tabor Academy as education always came first in my family. I was able to skate in games in the USHL, NAHL, EJHL during a year of junior A hockey, and I received multiple D1 scholarship offers. After a number of injuries and subsequent surgeries that did not go as expected, I decided to focus on my academics and gave up playing collegiately. <p>
I’ve been coaching hockey for about 20 years now. I began as a student assistant coach with the St Michaels College women’s team. I have coached U6, U8, U10, U12, and U14 both at the house level, the travel A, AA, and AAA levels. My philosophy is based around the 3 D’s which encourages players to fuel their Desire, utilize determination to achieve through adversity, and to learn discipline on and off the ice. This philosophy is shaped by the many wonderful coaches I was able to skate for during my playing days such as Terry O’Reilly, Brad Park, Brian Sutter, Jeff Jackson, Fran Murphy, Mark & Mike Bavis, Roger Grillo as well as a number of other folks. <p>
The past decade I have worked as a sales rep and sales leader in the technology industry. I currently fill the role of  RVP of sales and in this role I help coach my team to be successful in selling ERP/EPM/HCM products to C-suite decision makers at fortune 100 companies. In the early days of my career, I worked as a sales rep, sales leader, and sales trainer for a pharmaceutical company.

  <p>I have been a hockey dad since 2008 when my 4 year old daughter came to me and said I want to play hockey. Every year I would volunteer with tournaments and the concession stand. In our home town the hockey organization owns the rink concession stand and most of the funding for the program comes from the profits.<p>
 
In 2013 I ran for President of B.Y.S.A hockey (Barre youth sports association) Barre, Vermont and won the seat. I was president for 2 seasons.<p>
 
We then moved to NC and my daughter started playing for Junior Checkers out of XIC. During this time I coached the house summer league.<p>
 
When my daughter turned 12 we moved to Team Carolina girls program were I become a board member and helped run that program until the merger of the girls programs into what is now known as Jr. Canes girls. I stay involved with the team and help as much as I can.
